## 📝 Step 5: Submitting Feedback

Go to **#submit-bugs** or **#submit-features** and write:

```
#app-name Short description of the issue

Detailed explanation of what happened...
```

**Example:**
```
#defiknowledge Login button doesn't respond

When I tap the login button on the main screen, nothing happens. 
Tried 3 times on iPhone 14. The button highlights but no action occurs.
```

### 📸 **Include Screenshots!**

## ⚡ How Updates Work

This is the cool part! When you submit a bug:

1. ✅ Your submission goes to `#pending`
2. 🚀 A reviewer sends it to our AI coding system
3. 🤖 The AI implements the fix automatically
4. 📱 **You see the update in your app within minutes!**

Just close and reopen the app in Expo Go to get the latest version.
