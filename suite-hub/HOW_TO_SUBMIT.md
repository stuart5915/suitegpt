Welcome to SUITE Hub! Here's how to submit bugs and feature requests that our AI can fix automatically.

## 📝 **Format Your Submission**

```
#app-name Your bug/feature description

Details about what's happening...
```

**Example:**
```
#defiknowledge The loading spinner is white instead of blue

Expected: Blue spinner matching the app theme
Actual: White spinner that's hard to see on light backgrounds
```

## 📸 **Screenshots Help!**

Attach screenshots to show:
- Where the bug appears
- What you expected vs what happened
- Any error messages

Just drag & drop or paste images with your message!

## ✅ **What Happens Next**

1. Your submission goes to **#pending** for review
2. A reviewer clicks:
   - 🚀 **Send to AI** - Automatically implements the fix
   - ✅ **Approve** - Quick AI fix
   - 🔍 **Needs Info** - We need more details
3. You'll see updates in **#shipped** when it's live!

## 💡 **Tips for Good Submissions**

- **Be specific** - "Button doesn't work" vs "Login button on profile page shows error when clicked"
- **Include steps** - Tell us how to reproduce the issue
- **One issue per message** - Easier to track and fix
