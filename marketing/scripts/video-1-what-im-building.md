# Video Script: What I'm Building

## 1. HOOK (30 sec)

So I'm working on something kind of different. I'm building an ecosystem of AI-powered apps - we're talking health apps, finance tools, productivity stuff - all connected by one token. And here's the weird part: if you deposit money and barely use it, you might actually withdraw more than you put in. I'll explain how that works.

---

## 2. THE VISION (2 min)

Let me back up. The core idea is this: AI is incredible now, but it costs real money to run. Every time you scan a food label with AI, or ask a question to a personal assistant, or get investment insights - that's API calls, that's compute, that's dollars.

Most apps hide this with subscriptions. Pay ten bucks a month, use it twice, whatever. I hate that model. 

So instead, I'm building apps where you pay for what you actually use. Scan a food label? That's like 2 cents worth of SUITE tokens. Ask your AI life coach a question? Another few cents. You're only paying for the value you're getting.

But it goes deeper than that. All these apps share one wallet, one token called SUITE, and one treasury that's actually doing interesting stuff with your money while it sits there.

## 3. THE TREASURY MAGIC (3 min)

Okay this is the part that I think is really cool.

When you deposit money - let's say five dollars - it goes into the treasury. The treasury isn't just sitting there doing nothing. It's deployed into yield-generating strategies. DeFi stuff, liquidity positions, whatever's working at the time.

So your five dollars is earning yield. Let's say you use the apps a bit - you spend like fifty cents over a month. But the treasury earned you back thirty cents in yield.

Net result? You spent twenty cents net, not fifty.

But here's where it gets interesting. Let's say you deposit, forget about it, come back a month later. You barely used anything. You go to withdraw - and you actually have more than you deposited. Because the yield accumulated while your money sat there.

That's the model. Your deposits work for you, and usage costs are offset by treasury earnings. For light users, you might literally profit just by having funds in the system.

---

## 4. THE GIVING (1.5 min)

Now there's another piece to this. Initially, the treasury yields are being used to compound and grow the treasury. We're in bootstrap mode. But the plan is to allocate a percentage - let's say ten percent eventually - toward giving. Charity donations.

And here's the thing: it's not me deciding where that money goes. Token holders vote. Every month, we vote on which causes or charities get the giving allocation.

But this percentage, the ten percent, even the whole model - it's all adjustable. The users of the protocol, the voters, the community - you all decide how this evolves. I'm just building the infrastructure.

## 5. THE APPS (3 min)

So what apps am I actually building?

First there's FoodVital. Point your phone at a nutrition label, AI reads it, tells you if it's actually good for you based on your health goals. Instant food decisions.

Then Life Hub - basically a personal AI that knows your life. Your schedule, your goals, your memories. You talk to it, it helps you figure things out.

DeFi Knowledge is one for crypto people. Curated information about protocols, yields, strategies. Keeping track of the space so you don't have to.

I've got more in the works - productivity tools, dream journals, exercise apps. They're all connected. Same wallet, same token, same treasury earning yield on your deposits.

The idea is you're not managing ten different subscriptions. You're managing one balance that works across everything.

## 6. THE AUTOMATION (3 min)

Okay here's where it gets kind of meta.

I'm one person building all this. That's... a lot. So I built a system to help me build faster.

Here's how it works: I'm going through my day, I have an idea for a feature or a bug fix. I open Discord on my phone, post something like "the withdraw button should show the yield earned" - some rough thought.

That message gets picked up by an AI that refines it. Turns my rough idea into a clear task. I get a DM back with the polished version. I can approve it, ask questions, whatever.

If I approve it and I'm at my computer, I can run it manually. But if I'm not? I've got a bot watching for approved prompts. It literally starts my coding environment, feeds in the task, and the code writes itself.

So my apps are getting better while I sleep. While I'm out doing other stuff. That's the dream, right? Building something that builds itself.

And all of this is public. You can join the Discord and literally watch this happening in real time.

---

## 7. JOIN THE DISCORD - CTA (1 min)

Speaking of which - if any of this sounds interesting, come hang out.

The Discord is where everything happens. You can see the prompts coming in, see what's being built, see the automation running. It's all transparent.

And if you want to contribute? Start by just chatting. Drop into general, say hey, share ideas. I'm literally there. I'm using this Discord myself for my own workflow.

If your ideas are good, you'll get roles, you'll get involved, maybe you'll help build. But even if you just want to watch - that's cool too. Everything's visible.

## 8. THIS VIDEO SYSTEM (2 min)

One more thing. This video you're watching right now? It was made by AI.

That's my voice - well, a clone of my voice. I trained an AI on my voice and it narrates these videos. I write the scripts based on what I actually worked on that day, the AI speaks it, I add some screen recordings, done.

I'm making daily content about building this ecosystem... without spending hours editing videos. The system does it.

That's kind of the theme here. Use AI for everything possible. Build systems that run themselves. Spend my time on the creative parts, the thinking, the connecting with people like you.

---

## 9. FINAL CTA (1 min)

So that's what I'm building. An ecosystem of AI apps, connected by one token, powered by a yield-generating treasury that might actually make you money if you're a light user.

Everything's public. The code, the Discord, the decision-making.

If you want in:
- Join the Discord - link in the description
- Check out the wallet at stuarthollinger.com/wallet
- Follow along for daily updates on the build

I'll be there. Come say hey.
