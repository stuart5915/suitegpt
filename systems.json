Key installed skills include: frontend-design (production-grade UI with bold aesthetics), code-review, commit-commands, pr-review-toolkit, plugin-dev, and various LSP integrations. The frontend-design skill creates distinctive interfaces avoiding generic AI aesthetics - uses bold typography, memorable colors, high-impact animations, and unexpected layouts.",
