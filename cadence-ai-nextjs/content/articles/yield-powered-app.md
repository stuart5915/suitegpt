# AI powered apps. Free to use. DeFi pays the bills.

We are drowning in subscriptions. The modern software economy is a rent-seeking loop that drains us, month after month.

At **getSUITE**, we rejected this model. We built something for the community.

## The Indefinite License

Nothing is truly free. Servers, AI, and databases all cost money. The traditional answer is to pass that cost to you, with a markup, every 30 days.

Our answer is **The Treasury**.

When you join the SUITE ecosystem, you aren't paying rent. You are buying a share of a capital asset that works for all of us.

*   **You Deposit**: Add value via USD, CAD, Crypto, or simply watch an ad/complete earn activities.
*   **We Invest**: That capital goes into the **Suite Treasury** (smart contract).
*   **We Yield**: The Treasury stakes that capital in safe, high-yield DeFi protocols (like ETH staking).
*   **Yield Pays Costs**: The *interest* generated by that capital pays for the AI features you use.
*   **Withdraw Anytime**: Done with the ecosystem? Take your funds back instantly.
## The Principal Principle

Your initial contribution stays in the Treasury. It works for you forever.

Think about it: instead of paying a subscription every month, you place a small deposit (maybe $5 or $10) **once**. That deposit sits in the Treasury, generating yield that pays for your AI usage.

You essentially gain access to advanced AI tools for "free," paid for by the efficient use of capital. Thanks to DeFi, we can power our AI apps via microtransactions (like ads) and yield farming, and use L2s to keep transaction costs low.

### Try it for Free
Not ready to deposit? No problem.
*   **Watch an ad** to unlock a specific AI feature.
*   **Try the ecosystem** Open apps, try features without spending a dime.

## Keeping Your Money (Literally)
Here is the coolest part. Let's say you deposit $10. You use our AI apps for 3 months. Since the apps are free to use (paid by yield), your $10 is still there.

Actually, it might be more.

If you decide to leave, you don't just cancel a subscription. You withdraw your funds. You might even withdraw **$10.50**. You participate in an economy that grows while you sleep.

## Built by You, in Minutes

The getSUITE ecosystem isn't just about using apps; it's about building them. And you don't need to be a senior engineer to do it.

You build directly in **Discord**.

It works like this:
1.  **Command**: Type `/create app` in the chat.
2.  **Refine**: Use `/feature` to add capabilities (e.g., "Add a login screen" or "Add a crypto wallet").
3.  **Live**: Within 30 minutes, your app is deployed to the **getSUITE Store**, ready to download on your phone.

### The Realtime Reality

We offer this model because of our unique architecture. Our servers and translators take your prompts, generate actual code for real apps in real-time, and push it to a live GitHub codebase. The updates show up on your phone for testing within minutes.

The feedback loop is simple:
**You Build -> You Test -> You Refine -> You Publish**

All within minutes, for fractions of a cent.

Whether you want to build a tool for yourself, share a game with friends, or launch a full business, the barrier to entry is zero.

## This is the $SUITE Standard

Every app in our ecosystem—from the Store to the Builder—operates on this logic:
*   **Maximized Access**: Tools should be open to those who build.
*   **Reliable Yield**: Funded by DeFi, not monthly invoices.
*   **Community First**: Owned by the people who use it.

Stop renting your tools. Join the ecosystem that owns them.
