## Learned Patterns

Patterns learned from past proposals:

### Patterns That Lead to Rejection

**Too Broad:**
- Proposals covering multiple unrelated features
- "Complete redesign" or "overhaul" type proposals
- Integrating with many platforms at once

**Wrong Priority:**
- Marketing before core issues are fixed
- Nice-to-have features before must-have ones
- Complex features before simple ones work well

**Missing Justification:**
- Adding features without citing user data
- Changes without explaining expected impact
- Technical proposals without business rationale

**Out of Scope:**
- Changes affecting SUITE infrastructure
- Token/crypto related features
- Other apps in the ecosystem
- Budget or hiring decisions

### Patterns That Lead to Approval

**Focused Scope:**
- Single, specific feature or improvement
- Clear start and end points
- Achievable in one iteration

**Strong Justification:**
- Tied to specific user feedback
- Connected to success metrics
- Clear expected impact

**Practical Approach:**
- Realistic implementation plan
- Builds on existing foundation
