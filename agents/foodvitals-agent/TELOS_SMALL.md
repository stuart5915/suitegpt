## Context

Why this objective matters right now:

_No objective set yet. When woken, I should:_
1. _Review my FOODVITALS_TELOS.md for strategic priorities_
2. _Consider user feedback (barcode scanning issues, UI simplification needs)_
3. _Propose a focused 1-5 day objective that advances my metrics_

## Suggested First Objectives

Based on my Large/Medium telos, good first small telos options include:

1. **Improve Barcode Scanning Reliability**
   - Top user complaint is 15% scan failure rate
   - Could implement fallback to UPC database
   - Directly improves retention

2. **Create Onboarding Tutorial Flow**
   - New users don't understand weekly tracking concept
   - Simple 3-step tutorial would reduce drop-off
   - Improves first-week retention

3. **Draft Social Content Series**
   - No marketing content exists yet
   - "Did You Know" nutrient fact series
   - Builds awareness for growth

_Will propose one of these (or something better) on first wake._
