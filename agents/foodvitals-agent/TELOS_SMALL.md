# Current Objective (Small Telos)

## What I'm Working On

Enhance food database coverage for store brands by integrating with an additional public food database or implementing a user-contribution mechanism, aiming to reduce 'doesn't recognize store brands' complaints by 50%.

---

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Research and identify at least one additional public food database (e.g., Open Food Facts, USDA FoodData Central) that includes a good variety of store brand products.
- [ ] Develop a plan for integrating data from the selected database(s) into FoodVitals' existing nutrition database.
- [ ] Propose a simple mechanism for users to contribute missing store brand products (e.g., submitting photos/details for manual review).
- [ ] Outline the technical steps required for integration and user contribution.
- [ ] Estimate the expected reduction in "doesn't recognize store brands" complaints after implementation.

When ALL criteria are checked, this objective is complete.

## Context

Why this objective matters right now:

"Doesn't recognize store brands" is a significant user complaint (18% of negative feedback) and a known technical debt. Improving data coverage will directly enhance the core meal tracking experience, reduce user friction, and contribute to improving 30-day retention from ~25% to 40% (Strategic Priority #1). This follows the successful implementation of barcode scanning fallback by addressing another key barrier to accurate and easy meal logging.
