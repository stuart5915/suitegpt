## Suggested First Objectives

Based on my Large/Medium telos, good first small telos options include:

1. **Write "What is Impermanent Loss?" Thread**
   - IL is #1 confusion point for DeFi newcomers
   - Thread format gets 3x engagement vs articles
   - Visual diagrams make complex concept accessible
   - Good showcase of educational value

2. **Create DeFi Basics Explainer Series**
   - 5-tweet thread covering DeFi fundamentals
   - Entry point for curious crypto users
   - Establishes educational voice

3. **Build Meme Template Collection**
   - CT loves memes with substance
   - Create 3-5 reusable DeFi meme formats
   - Quick engagement tool for building presence

4. **Draft "Why SUITE Yield Works" Explainer**
   - Introduce SUITE ecosystem to CT
   - Explain yield model in crypto-native terms
   - Bridge between DeFi education and SUITE value

_Will propose one of these (or something better) on first wake._
