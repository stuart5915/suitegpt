                <h1>Reward Pool</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">How bonus credits work and where they come from.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box highlight-box--warm">
                    <h4>The Simple Explanation</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">When you buy credits, your USDC goes into a reward pool that's actively managed. As the pool grows, you earn bonus credits proportional to your share. These bonus credits can be withdrawn for USDC.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                <div class="earn-grid">
                    <div class="earn-card">
                        <div class="icon">1</div>
                        <div class="title">Buy Credits</div>
                        <div class="desc">Pay $1 in USDC and receive 1,000 credits to use in apps. Your USDC goes into the reward pool.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="earn-card">
                        <div class="icon">2</div>
                        <div class="title">Pool Is Managed</div>
                        <div class="desc">The reward pool is actively managed. The goal is to grow its value over time, but performance is not guaranteed.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="earn-card">
                        <div class="icon">3</div>
                        <div class="title">You Earn Bonus Credits</div>
                        <div class="desc">When the pool value increases, bonus credits are distributed to all credit holders proportionally. These represent your share of the gains.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="earn-card">
                        <div class="icon">4</div>
                        <div class="title">Withdraw Your Share</div>

                </div>

                <h2>Two Types of Credits</h2>

                <div class="earn-grid" style="grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);">
                    <div class="earn-card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--accent-warm);">
                        <div class="title" style="color: var(--accent-warm);">Credits (Purchased)</div>
                        <div class="desc">Used for AI features in apps. Spent when you use analysis, recommendations, etc. Cannot be withdrawn.</div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="earn-card" style="border-left: 4px solid var(--success);">
                        <div class="title" style="color: var(--success);">Bonus Credits (Earned)</div>
                        <div class="desc">Your share of pool growth. Distributed when the pool value increases. Can be withdrawn for USDC.</div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Important Notes</h2>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <h4>This Is Not Guaranteed</h4>
                    <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The reward pool value can go up or down. There's no guaranteed return. Bonus credits are only distributed when the pool grows. If the pool shrinks, no bonus credits are issued.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>What You Can Withdraw</h3>
                <p>Only <strong>bonus credits</strong> can be withdrawn. Credits you purchase directly are for using apps - they're spent when you use AI features and can't be withdrawn.</p>

                <h3>Withdrawal Process</h3>
                <div class="steps-container">
                    <div class="step-item">
                        <span class="step-num">1</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <strong>Request</strong>
                            <span>Submit a withdrawal request for the amount you want</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-item">
                        <span class="step-num">2</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <strong>Queue</strong>
                            <span>Your request enters the queue while funds are prepared</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="step-item">
                        <span class="step-num">3</span>
                        <div class="step-content">
                            <strong>Claim</strong>
                            <span>When ready, claim your USDC to your wallet</span>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h2>Paying with Card (Fiat)</h2>
                <p>You can also buy credits with a credit/debit card. The same rules apply:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You receive credits to use in SUITE apps</li>
                    <li>Your payment contributes to the reward pool</li>
                    <li>You earn bonus credits when the pool grows</li>
                    <li>Bonus credits can be withdrawn for USDC</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Can I withdraw the credits I purchased?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>No.</strong> Purchased credits are for using AI features in apps. They get spent when you use the apps. Only <em>bonus credits</em> (earned from pool growth) can be withdrawn.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Can I earn more than I put in?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Potentially, yes.</strong> If the reward pool grows significantly, your bonus credits could be worth more than your original purchase. However, this is not guaranteed - the pool value can go up or down.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">What happens if the pool loses value?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">If the pool value decreases, no bonus credits are distributed. Your purchased credits still work in apps, but there's nothing extra to withdraw. We never distribute negative bonus credits.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">How are bonus credits calculated?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">When the pool grows, the gains are distributed proportionally. If you hold 10% of all credits and the pool grows by $100, you'd receive bonus credits worth $10 at the current redemption rate.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">What's the redemption rate?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">The redemption rate is: <code>Pool Value ÷ Total Credits in Circulation</code>. When you withdraw bonus credits, this rate determines how much USDC you receive.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Is this an investment?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>No.</strong> You're buying credits to use apps. The bonus credits are a reward for participating in the ecosystem, not a guaranteed return on investment. The pool is actively managed but performance is not guaranteed.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" style="margin-bottom: 24px;">
                    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 8px;">What payment methods are accepted?</h4>
                    <p style="margin: 0;">You can pay with USDC (crypto) directly, or use a credit/debit card. Card payments are processed securely through Stripe.</p>
