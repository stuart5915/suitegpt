                <section class="faith-section">
                    <h2>The Ultimate Foundation</h2>
                    <div class="faith-card">
                        <p>SUITE is built on a foundation that goes deeper than technology. At its core, this ecosystem
                            is rooted in the Christian faith — the belief that <span class="highlight">Jesus is
                                God</span>, and that everything we build should ultimately point toward Him.</p>

                        <p>This isn't just a philosophical stance. It's the lens through which every decision is made:
                            Why do we give 10% to charity? Because generosity reflects God's nature.
                            Why do we believe everyone deserves to be paid fairly? Because every person has inherent
                            dignity.
                            Why do we want AI to serve humanity, not control it? Because humans are made in God's image.
                        </p>

                        <div class="scripture-block">
                            "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
                            <span class="reference">— John 1:1</span>
                        </div>

                        <p>The SUITE Bible page talks about "naming things into existence." This is the image of the
                            Creator — speaking reality into being. When we create, we reflect (imperfectly) the One who
                            created us.</p>

                <section class="faith-section">
                    <h2>What This Means for SUITE</h2>
                    <div class="faith-card">
                        <p><strong>For the ecosystem:</strong> The systems we build should harness energy for good.
                            Technology is a tool — it can amplify goodness or amplify harm. Our commitment is to
                            amplify the good.</p>

                        <p><strong>For AI:</strong> Autonomous systems need guardrails not because we fear technology,
                            but because we understand the reality of Good and Evil. We want AI that serves, not AI that
                            dominates.</p>

                        <p><strong>For community:</strong> SUITE is meant to empower people — to build, to earn, to
                            give. This reflects the Christian ethic of service: the greatest among us are those who
                            serve others.</p>

                        <p><strong>For you:</strong> You don't have to share this faith to use SUITE. But if you're
                            curious about the foundation, we invite you to explore.</p>

                        <p>👥 <strong>Find Community:</strong> Faith is meant to be lived with others. Find a local
