            <h2>The Subscription Trap</h2>

            <p>$9.99/month. $14.99/month. $29.99/month.</p>

            <p>Modern software has become a slow bleed. You pay, month after month, for tools you don't fully own. Miss a payment? Access revoked. Want to leave? Your data might not come with you.</p>

            <p>The subscription economy extracts value from users and concentrates it at the top. We built something different.</p>

            <h2>The Treasury Model</h2>

            <p>At SUITE, you don't pay rent. You make a <strong>one-time deposit</strong> into The Treasury—a shared pool of capital managed by smart contracts.</p>

            <p>Here's how it works:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>You Deposit</strong>: Add funds via USD, CAD, or crypto. Even small amounts work.</li>
                <li><strong>Treasury Invests</strong>: Your capital gets staked in battle-tested DeFi protocols (ETH staking, stablecoin lending, etc.).</li>
                <li><strong>Yield Covers Costs</strong>: The interest generated pays for AI compute, servers, and infrastructure—so you don't have to.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Principal Stays Yours</strong>: The money you deposited? Still there. Withdraw it anytime.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>No monthly fees. No invoices. Your deposit works for you, not against you.</p>

            <h2>You Control the Split</h2>

            <p>Here's where it gets interesting. The Treasury generates yield from two sources:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>DeFi Yield</strong>: Interest from staking and lending protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>App Revenue</strong>: When apps in the ecosystem generate revenue, a portion flows back to the Treasury.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You decide how that yield gets distributed. Set your own split:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More to You</strong>: Take a larger share of the yield as passive income. Your deposit earns while you sleep.</li>
                <li><strong>More to Treasury</strong>: Contribute more to the collective pool. This funds more AI development, more apps, and grows the ecosystem faster.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It's a slider. Your choice. No judgment either way.</p>

            <p>Want 80% of your yield as income? Done. Want to reinvest 100% into the ecosystem? Also done. The power is yours.</p>

            <h2>Free AI. Real Ownership.</h2>

            <p>Because of this model, you get access to advanced AI-powered apps without paying subscriptions. The collective yield handles the compute costs.</p>

            <p>But here's the key difference from "free" apps you're used to: <strong>you're not the product</strong>.</p>

            <p>We don't sell your data. We don't stuff ads down your throat. We don't optimize for engagement at the cost of your wellbeing.</p>

            <p>The Treasury model aligns our incentives with yours. When the ecosystem grows, we all benefit. When you succeed, the Treasury grows. It's symbiotic, not extractive.</p>

            <h2>The Flywheel</h2>

            <p>This model creates a positive feedback loop:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>More users deposit into the Treasury</li>
                <li>Bigger Treasury means more yield</li>
                <li>More yield funds more AI-built apps</li>
                <li>More apps attract more users</li>
                <li>Cycle repeats</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A rising tide lifts all boats. Early contributors benefit from ecosystem growth. Later contributors benefit from a mature, feature-rich platform. Everyone wins.</p>

            <h2>Apps That Serve, Not Extract</h2>

            <p>Most apps are designed to maximize engagement. Keep you scrolling. Keep you clicking. Keep you addicted.</p>

            <p>SUITE apps are different. They're built to help you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health apps</strong> that actually improve your wellbeing</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity tools</strong> that respect your time</li>
                <li><strong>Finance apps</strong> that grow your wealth, not drain it</li>
                <li><strong>Learning tools</strong> that make you smarter, not dumber</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When apps are funded by yield instead of ads, the incentive shifts. We don't need to hijack your attention. We just need to build things that genuinely help.</p>

            <h2>Economic Freedom First</h2>

            <p>Our immediate goal is simple: <strong>economic freedom</strong>.</p>

            <p>Keep your money. Grow your money. Own your tools. Stop paying rent on software you depend on.</p>

            <p>But that's just the start.</p>

            <p>Economic freedom unlocks other freedoms. When you're not stressed about bills, you have time freedom. When you own your tools, you have creative freedom. When your apps serve you instead of exploit you, you have mental freedom.</p>

            <p>We're building the infrastructure for a different kind of economy. One where technology works for humans, not the other way around.</p>

            <p>Economic freedom is the foundation. What we build on top of it? That's up to all of us.</p>
